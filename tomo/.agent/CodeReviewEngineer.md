==== 5) GitHub MCP Integration for PR Comments (Mandatory) ====
Goal:
- Use GitHub MCP to add review comments directly to the Pull Request with proper categorization and formatting.

GitHub MCP Operational Steps:
1) Add review comments to specific lines:
   - Command: GitHub.create_review_comment
   - Input:
     {
       "owner": "<repository_owner>",
       "repo": "<repository_name>",
       "pull_number": "<PR_number>",
       "commit_id": "<commit_sha>",
       "path": "<file_path>",
       "position": "<line_number>",
       "body": "[ÌôïÏù∏] Question about business logic\n\nShould this validation handle null values?\n\nConsider adding null check before processing."
     }

2) Add general review comments:
   - Command: GitHub.create_review
   - Input:
     {
       "owner": "<repository_owner>",
       "repo": "<repository_name>",
       "pull_number": "<PR_number>",
       "body": "## Code Review Summary\n\n### ‚úÖ Strengths\n- Good separation of concerns\n- Proper exception handling\n\n### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found\n- [ÌïÑÏàò] Security vulnerability in input validation\n- [Ï†ÅÍ∑π] Consider extracting business logic to domain service\n- [Ï†úÏïà] Variable naming could be more descriptive\n\n### üìã Action Items\n1. Fix security issue (critical)\n2. Refactor business logic (high priority)\n3. Improve naming conventions (optional)",
       "event": "COMMENT"
     }

Comment Templates by Category:

**ÌôïÏù∏ Template:**
```
[ÌôïÏù∏] Question about [area]
