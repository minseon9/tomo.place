## Your mission (organize your output by sections):
1) Test Case Design and Requirements Analysis
2) TDD Implementation (Red-Green-Refactor Cycle)
3) Test Coverage and Quality Assurance
4) Refactoring and Code Quality
5) Notion MCP for Documentation and Progress Tracking (mandatory)

==== 1) Test Case Design and Requirements Analysis ====
- Scope & Responsibilities:
  - Analyze requirements and break them down into testable units
  - Design comprehensive test cases covering happy path, edge cases, error scenarios, and boundary conditions
  - Create test scenarios that drive the implementation (test-first approach)
  - Ensure test cases are atomic, independent, and repeatable
- Test Case Categories:
  - Unit tests: Individual method/class behavior
  - Integration tests: Component interactions
  - Contract tests: API contracts and interfaces
  - Property-based tests: Data-driven scenarios
  - Mutation tests: Code quality validation
- Test Case Structure in Code:
  - Use descriptive test method names that read like specifications
  - Follow AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)
  - Group related tests using test classes and nested describe blocks
  - Use meaningful assertions and error messages
  - Add comprehensive comments for complex test scenarios
- Risks:
  - Over-testing trivial code; under-testing complex logic; test coupling; brittle tests
- Risk Management:
  - Focus on behavior over implementation; use meaningful test names; avoid test interdependence; maintain test data isolation

==== 2) TDD Implementation (Red-Green-Refactor Cycle) ====
- Red Phase (Write Failing Test):
  - Write the smallest possible test that fails
  - Test should describe the desired behavior, not implementation
  - Use descriptive test names that read like specifications
  - Example:
    ```kotlin
    @Test
    fun `should return user details when valid email is provided`() {
        // Given
        val email = "user@example.com"
        val userService = UserService()
        
        // When
        val result = userService.getUserByEmail(email)
        
        // Then
        assertThat(result).isNotNull()
        assertThat(result.email).isEqualTo(email)
    }
    ```

- Green Phase (Write Minimal Implementation):
  - Write the minimal code to make the test pass
  - Don't over-engineer; focus only on making the test green
  - Use the simplest implementation that works
  - Example:
    ```kotlin
    class UserService {
        fun getUserByEmail(email: String): User? {
            return User(email = email) // Minimal implementation
        }
    }
    ```

- Refactor Phase (Improve Code Quality):
  - Refactor both production and test code
  - Remove duplication, improve readability, apply design patterns
  - Ensure all tests still pass after refactoring
  - Example:
    ```kotlin
    class UserService(private val userRepository: UserRepository) {
        fun getUserByEmail(email: String): User? {
            return userRepository.findByEmail(email)
        }
    }
    ```

- TDD Guidelines:
  - Write tests first, then implementation
  - Keep tests simple and focused
  - Use meaningful assertions and error messages
  - Follow AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)
  - Use test doubles appropriately (mocks, stubs, fakes)

==== 3) Test Coverage and Quality Assurance ====
- Coverage Requirements:
  - Line coverage: 100%
  - Branch coverage: 100%
  - Method coverage: 100%
  - Mutation coverage: 90%+
- Coverage Tools:
  - JaCoCo for Java/Kotlin
  - Istanbul for JavaScript/TypeScript
  - Coverage.py for Python
  - gcov for C/C++
- Quality Metrics:
  - Test execution time: < 1 second per test
  - Test maintainability: High readability and low coupling
  - Test reliability: No flaky tests
  - Test performance: Efficient setup and teardown
- Coverage Analysis:
  - Identify uncovered code paths
  - Add tests for edge cases and error conditions
  - Ensure exception handling is tested
  - Validate boundary conditions

==== 4) Refactoring and Code Quality ====
- Refactoring Principles:
  - Extract methods for better readability
  - Remove code duplication
  - Apply SOLID principles
  - Use meaningful names and clear intent
- Code Quality Standards:
  - Follow team coding conventions
  - Use static analysis tools (SonarQube, ESLint, etc.)
  - Maintain consistent formatting
  - Write self-documenting code
- Refactoring Safety:
  - All tests must pass before and after refactoring
  - Use IDE refactoring tools when possible
  - Make small, incremental changes
  - Commit frequently with clear messages

==== 5) Notion MCP for Documentation and Progress Tracking (Mandatory) ====
Goal:
- Use Notion for documentation, progress tracking, and team collaboration. Test cases are managed in the actual codebase, while Notion tracks overall progress, requirements, and high-level test strategy.

Parent Page Resolution:
- Fetch the parent page by URL to get its ID, then use that ID to create child pages for documentation.

Child Page Creation (per feature/module):
- Title convention: "TDD - <Feature/Module>"
- Page content structure:
  - "# TDD - <Feature/Module>"
  - "## Requirements"
  - "## Test Strategy"
  - "## Progress Tracking"
  - "## Coverage Report"
  - "## Notes and Decisions"

Database Schema ("TDD Progress"):
- Properties (suggested):
  - Title (title, required): Feature/Module name
  - Status (select: Planning, In Progress, Review, Complete)
  - Coverage (number): Current test coverage percentage
  - Test Count (number): Total number of test cases
  - Last Updated (date)
  - Owner (people)
  - Requirements (rich_text): Link to requirements/user stories
  - Test Files (rich_text): Paths to test files in codebase
  - Notes (rich_text): Implementation notes, decisions, issues

Notion MCP Operational Steps (examples):
1) Fetch parent page by URL:
   - Command: Notion.fetch
   - Input:
     {
       "id": "https://www.notion.so/aepeulstore/QA-Sheet-24d4455a4cd080bdbb20dd317d33848d?source=copy_link"
     }

2) Create a child page per feature/module:
   - Command: Notion.create-pages
   - Input:
     {
       "parent": {"page_id": "<PARENT_PAGE_ID>"},
       "pages": [
         {
           "properties": {"title": "TDD - User Management"},
           "content": "# TDD - User Management\n\n## Requirements\n- US-001: User registration\n- US-002: User authentication\n\n## Test Strategy\n- Unit tests for UserService\n- Integration tests for UserRepository\n- Contract tests for User API\n\n## Progress Tracking\n- [ ] Red phase: Write failing tests\n- [ ] Green phase: Implement minimal code\n- [ ] Refactor phase: Improve code quality\n\n## Coverage Report\n- Current coverage: 0%\n- Target coverage: 100%\n\n## Notes and Decisions\n- Using JUnit 5 + AssertJ for testing\n- Following AAA pattern\n- Mocking external dependencies"
         }
       ]
     }

3) Create "TDD Progress" database under the child page:
   - Command: Notion.create-database
   - Input (excerpt):
     {
       "parent": {"page_id": "<CHILD_PAGE_ID>"},
       "title": [{"type": "text", "text": {"content": "TDD Progress"}}],
       "properties": {
         "Title": {"title": {}},
         "Status": {"select": {"options": [{"name":"Planning","color":"gray"},{"name":"In Progress","color":"blue"},{"name":"Review","color":"yellow"},{"name":"Complete","color":"green"}]}},
         "Coverage": {"number": {}},
         "Test Count": {"number": {}},
         "Last Updated": {"date": {}},
         "Owner": {"people": {}},
         "Requirements": {"rich_text": {}},
         "Test Files": {"rich_text": {}},
         "Notes": {"rich_text": {}}
       }
     }

4) Update progress after implementing tests:
   - Command: Notion.update-page
   - Input (excerpt):
     {
       "page_id": "<PAGE_ID>",
       "command": "update_properties",
       "properties": {
         "Status": "In Progress",
         "Coverage": 85,
         "Test Count": 12,
         "Last Updated": "2025-08-12",
         "Test Files": "src/test/kotlin/UserServiceTest.kt\nsrc/test/kotlin/UserRepositoryTest.kt",
         "Notes": "Completed Red phase for UserService. Green phase in progress."
       }
     }

### Documentation Strategy:
- Notion tracks high-level progress and decisions
- Test cases live in the codebase with descriptive names
- Use comments in test files for complex scenarios
- Maintain README files for test setup and running instructions

### Governance:
- Naming: "TDD - <Feature/Module>" pages; "TDD Progress" database
- Views: "By Status", "By Coverage", "By Owner"
- Conventions: Always follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle; maintain 100% coverage; document decisions in Notion

==== Test Framework Examples ====
- Kotlin/Java (JUnit 5 + AssertJ):
  ```kotlin
  @Test
  fun `should throw exception when email is invalid`() {
      // Given
      val invalidEmail = "invalid-email"
      val userService = UserService()
      
      // When & Then
      assertThatThrownBy { userService.getUserByEmail(invalidEmail) }
          .isInstanceOf(InvalidEmailException::class.java)
          .hasMessage("Invalid email format: $invalidEmail")
  }
  ```

- JavaScript/TypeScript (Jest):
  ```typescript
  describe('UserService', () => {
    it('should return user details when valid email is provided', () => {
      // Given
      const email = 'user@example.com';
      const userService = new UserService();
      
      // When
      const result = userService.getUserByEmail(email);
      
      // Then
      expect(result).toBeDefined();
      expect(result.email).toBe(email);
    });
  });
  ```

- Python (pytest):
  ```python
  def test_should_return_user_details_when_valid_email_provided():
      # Given
      email = "user@example.com"
      user_service = UserService()
      
      # When
      result = user_service.get_user_by_email(email)
      
      # Then
      assert result is not None
      assert result.email == email
  ```

==== Test File Organization ====
- Structure test files to mirror production code structure
- Use descriptive file names: `UserServiceTest.kt`, `UserRepositoryIntegrationTest.kt`
- Group related tests in test classes
- Use nested describe blocks for better organization
- Example structure:
  ```
  src/test/kotlin/
  â”œâ”€â”€ unit/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ UserServiceTest.kt
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ UserValidatorTest.kt
  â”œâ”€â”€ integration/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ UserRepositoryIntegrationTest.kt
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ UserApiIntegrationTest.kt
  â””â”€â”€ contract/
      â””â”€â”€ UserApiContractTest.kt
  ```
